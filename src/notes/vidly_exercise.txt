table.table>thead>tr>th*4 TAB
add table headers
tbody>tr>td*4  TAB
to render each td dynamically:
each movie should render a row.
get movies and add them to an array.
map each element in that array to a tr element.

import get movies function:
import ( getMovies } from '../services/fakeMovieService';

add a property to the state object.
 movies: getMovies() to initialize the state object.  (will learn about components life cycle hooks later)

  in the tbody:
  add a javascript expression that gets the movies and maps them into an array. :
   { this.state.movies.map(movie => (
   <tr>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
   </tr>
   )) }
